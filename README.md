# mrkt

A bunch of tools for automating stock market analysis, written primarily in Python. 

### Installation

To install, download or fork this project and clone on your local machine. 

The API being used for this project is [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/). In order to use the MRKT tools, you will need to first run the setup.py script in your command line, which will automatically generate your personal configuration file. 

**NOTE** - Have your AlphaVantage API key ready before running the setup.py script!!!

### Features to be added

* Check for valid ticker symbol
* GUI and/or web frontend
* Option to store query results in various formats
* Charts for time series data in terminal would be really cool (if a bit silly)
* Support for multiple watchlists
* Ticker symbol lookup

### Demo

More polished output to be added later
